# Field Mapping System - Frontend & Backend Integration

## Overview

This project includes both the **frontend** and **backend** for the **Field Mapping System**. The **frontend** is built using **Vue 3**, **TypeScript**, and **Leaflet.js**, while the **backend** is a **FastAPI** application. The system allows users to view and interact with field boundaries on an interactive map, providing a complete solution for managing field and farmer data.

- **Vue 3 + TypeScript**: Fast and efficient frontend using Vue 3 with TypeScript for type safety.
- **Real-time Integration**: The frontend fetches field and farmer data from the FastAPI backend.

### Backend:

- **FastAPI**: A modern and fast web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **Field Management**: Store and retrieve field data, including coordinates for boundaries.
- **Farmer Data**: Handle farmer information and their respective fields.
